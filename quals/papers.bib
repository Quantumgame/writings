	potential motor actions and select between them. We review how recent
	neurophysiological data from diverse cortical and subcortical regions
	appear more compatible with this parallel view than with the classical

	The two-dimensional probes with 96 or 64 recording sites provided
	high-density recording of unit and field activity with minimal tissue
	displacement or damage. The on-chip active circuit eliminated movement
	and other artifacts and greatly reduced the weight of the headgear.
	The precise geometry of the recording tips allowed for the estimation
	of the spatial location of the recorded neurons and for high-resolution
	estimation of extracellular current source density. Action potentials
	could be simultaneously recorded from the soma and dendrites of the
	same neurons. Silicon technology is a promising approach for high-density,

  abstract = {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep

	Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive

	areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained
	on supervised learning
	
	tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised
	pre-training phase.
	
	Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models,
	many questions remain as to
	
	the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated
	here is the following:
	
	how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions
	is important if learning in
	
	deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory
	hypotheses and test
	
	them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence
	of pre-training with respect
	
	to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples.
	The experiments confirm
	
	and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results
	suggest that unsupervised pretraining
	
	guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support
	better generalization
	
	from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports
	a regularization explanation for
	
	the effect of pre-training.},

  abstract = {Neuronal gamma-band synchronization is found in many cortical areas,
	is induced by different stimuli or tasks, and is related to several
	cognitive capacities. Thus, it appears as if many different gamma-band
	synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue
	that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves
	an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation
	unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural
	neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence,
	which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses.
	However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only
	if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only
	one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection
	can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with
	neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least
	one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which
	then subserves numerous higher cognitive functions.},

  review = {- Signal detection theory is a mathematical framework for making decisions
	
	 - Hypothesis about world states are encoded as h1, h2
	
	 - Actions associated with world states are encoded as (H1, h1), (H2,
	h2)
	
	 - Values encode the value of taking an action given a world state,
	v(H1 | h1), v(H1 | H2)
	
	 - Sensory input is transformed into evidence about a world state:
	e
	
	 - Likelihoods are computed on the evidence: P(e | h1), P(e | h2)
	
	 - Likelihood ratios can serve as decision variables DV = log( P(e
	| h1) / P(e | h2) )
	
	 - The DV can also include values in the calculation.
	
	 - When the DV reaches a threshold, a decision is made
	
	
	- Sequential analysis deals with a stream of evidence that evolves
	over time: e1, e2, e3, ...
	
	 - The decision variable is computed online and when a certain point
	is reached a decision/action is made
	
	 - The Sequential Probability Ratio Test computes an update weight
	at each step equal to the
	
	 log likelihood of the evidence that arrives at time t: w_t = log(
	P(e_t | h1) / P(e_t | h2) ) )
	
	 - The cumulative sum of w_t's is taken into account as the decision
	variable
	
	
	- Papers that talk about decision variables being encoded in higher
	level cortex:

	of somatosensory
	
	parametric working memory in macaque prefrontal cortex. Cereb. Cortex

	of decisionmaking
	
	in secondary somatosensory cortex. Nat. Neurosci. 5:1217–25
	
	
	- Monkeys were given a task where their hand was stimulated with two
	frequencies f1 and f2, and
	
	had to make a decision as to whether f2 > f1
	
	- Area S1 encoded the evidence (the actual frequencies of stimulation),
	and higher order cortex
	
	encoded things that were closer to decision variables. The areas included
	S2, the dorso-lateral
	
	pre-frontal cortex (dlPFC), and especially the medial and ventral
	pre-motor corticies (MPC and VPC)
	
	
	- "One challenge is to understand the apparent redundancy. For example,
	memory traces of f 1 and
	
	f 1/f 2 comparisons are both found in S2, VPC, MPC, and dlPFC. Do
	the subtle differences in how those
	
	computations manifest in the different brain areas indicate subtly
	different roles in these processes?
	
	Or is there simply a continuous flow of information through these
	circuits, such that each performs
	
	a unique role but has continuous access to the computations performed
	by the other circuits?
	
	
	- In a random dot motion (RDM) task, a monkey has to decide if a group
	of random dots is going in
	
	one direction or another.
	
	- Evidence for this task has been traced to be accumulated in the
	middle temporal area (MT/V5).
	
	- "individual MT neurons weakly but significantly predict the monkey’s
	direction decisions, including errors"
	
	- Saccades were invoked by microstimulation of the FEF during the
	decision-making process, and those
	
	saccades tended to deviate towards the direction of the final decision,
	indicating that information about
	
	the decision was shared with motor areas while evidence accumulated.
	
	- Neurons in LIP seem to encode the decision variable for the RDM
	task where reaction time is
	
	important. More specifically they seem to integrate evidence over
	time in the RDM task.
	
	
	- Potentially interesting paper about computing decisions:

  volume = {14},
  pages = {2531-2560},
  abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous
	
	stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can
	be
	
	processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire
	neurons
	
	in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing
	
	on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms
	
	based onTuring machines or attractor neural networks. It does not
	require
	
	a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based
	on
	
	principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with
	
	statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved
	or
	
	found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient
	dynamics
	
	of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently
	large
	
	and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading
	
	memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the
	current
	
	state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and
	
	past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal
	states
	
	are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal
	states
	
	can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due
	to
	
	the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based
	
	on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that,
	unlike
	
	Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between welldefined
	
	discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine
	
	is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational
	
	power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic
	
	scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach
	
	provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding,
	the
	
	design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the

	- Depolarization of primary sensory cell in follicle activates firing

	- Trigeminal-thalamo neurons are arranged in "barrellettes" specific
	to one whisker
	
	
	- Trigeminal-thalamo neurons project to Ventral Posterior Medial (VPM)
	portion of thalamus

	- Trigeminal neurons also project to trigeminal spinal neurons in

	- The trigeminal spinal interpolaris is split into two functionally
	distinct regions.
	
	 - The caudal part is the "extralemniscal pathway", it projects to
	the "septal" regions of mouse S1 and secondary somatosensory cortex
	
	 - The rostral part is the "paralemniscal pathway", it projects to

	active exploration, perhaps contributing to sensorimotor coordination."
	
	
	- VPM neurons project to layer 4 of the primary sensory cortex and
	form a "barrel map"
	
	- Cortex responds with alot of trial-to-trial variability, and single
	barrels respond to multiple whiskers, in contrast to VPM
	
	
	- Different whiskers have different resonant frequencies, so in addition
	to a spatial map, the barrel cortex might provide a "texture map",
	where the texture of an object interacts with the resonant frequency
	tunings of whiskers. Longer whiskers have lower resonant frequencies.
	
	
	- In rat, layer 4 neurons within a barrel can be subdivided into ones
	that have a specific direction preference, but don't have an obvious
	organization
	
	- Layer 2/3 neurons have maps of direction preferences. The direction
	preferences might be shared across barrels, so that deflection of
	one whisker towards another whisker has an anatomical correlate within
	layer 2/3 between the two barrels
	
	
	- Interesting work using VSD to map spread of depolarization from
	layer 4 to layer 2/3:

	columns of rat somatosensory barrel cortex revealed with voltage
	sensitive dye imaging. J. Neurosci. 21, 8435–8446.
	
	2) Laaris, N., and Keller, A. (2002). Functional independence of layer
	IV barrels. J. Neurophysiol. 87, 1028–1034.
	
	
	- Axons of layer 2/3 neurons form prominent input to layer 5 neurons.
	Layer 5 neurons also receive input from thalamus and layer 4!
	
	
	- POM projects to layer 1 and 5A, and layer 5A projects to layer 2
	
	
	- Whisker trimming reduces connection strength between layer 4 and
	layer 2/3, by reduction of presynaptic transmitter release probability
	
	
	- Map plasticity: when only a single whisker is left, the cortical
	region responding to stimulation of that whisker grows larger. The
	process is reversible. However, the reverse phenomenon happens when
	the animal is allowed to explore a novel environment every 3-4 days.
	The author states that this clearly demonstrates the importance of
	behavioral context for S1 activity.
	
	
	- In layer 2/3, during quiet wakefullness there are large amplitude
	slow oscillations in membrane potental that propagate as waves, visible
	by VSD. During active whisking, the oscillation disappears, the variance
	of the membrane potential decreases, neurons depolarize by a few
	mV.},

	our view on the organization of the motor cortex in primates. In
	the present article we present this view and discuss its fundamental
	principles. The basic principles are the following: (a) the motor
	cortex, defined as the agranular frontal cortex, is formed by a mosaic
	of separate areas, each of which contains an independent body movement
	representation, (b) each motor area plays a specific role in motor
	control, based on the specificity of its cortical afferents and descending
	projections, (c) in analogy to the motor cortex, the posterior parietal
	cortex is formed by a multiplicity of areas, each of which is involved
	in the analysis of particular aspects of sensory information. There
	are no such things as multipurpose areas for space or body schema
	and (d) the parieto-frontal connections form a series of segregated
	anatomical circuits devoted to specific sensorimotor transformations.
	These circuits transform sensory information into action. They represent
	the basic functional units of the motor system. Although these conclusions
	mostly derive from monkey experiments, anatomical and brain-imaging
	evidence suggest that the organization of human motor cortex is based
	on the same principles. Possible homologies between the motor cortices
	of humans and non-human primates are discussed.},

	sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate
	and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between
	a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the
	body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build
	adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions
	of these internal models, called forward models because they transform
	motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce
	a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of
	the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world
	around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased
	predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated
	through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

	- Implicates the cerebellum in generating a "forward model" of action

	- A forward model is one that predicts the sensory consequences of
	a motor action
	
	- Theorizes that the cerebellum predicts the state of the the limb
	from the history of motor commands, complementing estimated state
	from sensory input
	
	- When taking a picture of a moving target, the background seems to
	go in the opposite direction. The reason it doesn't look like this
	to the brain is because the brain produces a prediction of what the
	shifted visual image should look like due to a saccade
	
	- There are two data streams: the observed sensory environment scene
	and the predicted sensory environment
	
	- When the prediction is viewed as the prior, and the sensory input
	as the evidence, the optimal weighted integration of the two can
	be accomplished using a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter minimizes
	the variance of the predicted sensory state
	
	- Kording and Wolpert (2004) perform experiments where the sensory
	input is probabalistic and the weighting of it is dependent on it's
	variance
