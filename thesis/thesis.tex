\begin{acknowledgements}

Thank you to my parents, whose excellent work ethics set an example I've followed all my life. Dad, you told me when I was 4 that if I could read, I could do anything. I listened and learned from you. Mom, your work in hospitals and fascination with medicine and the human body is one of the things that inspired me to move towards Biology. And you know, being a loving and caring mom was also useful. 

Thank you to my brothers. Joe and Tom, you guys are more than I could have asked for. Reliable, supportive, funny, and good drinking buddies. Joe, your devotion to protecting your family and our country is exemplary, your wit is top notch, and I have nothing but respect for you. Tom, you're a super nice dude, and an excellent craftsman, whether you're building houses or playgrounds for cats.

Thanks to Northeast Public High School and the Magnet program. It's unfathomable how anyone could rationalize the defunding of public schools. I would not have written this thesis if it wasn't for Northeast.

Thank you to my former coworkers at Bluestone Software/Hewlett Packard. You showed me the ropes of programming, guiding me away from the awful complexities of C++ and into the milder complexities of Java. You gave me a chance to learn, to travel, and helped me to acquire a proper coffee habit.

Thanks to Dr. Edward Gruberg, who helped introduce me to Neuroscience at Temple University. You noted that I was a bit rough around the edges, but let me perform behavioral experiments on frogs, where I tied crickets to strings, and dangled them at various angles with respect to the frog's field of vision, to test whether lesions in the optic tectum (or was it the nucleus isthmi?) affected prey/predator responses.

Thanks to Robert G. Smith at University of Pennsylvania, who taught me the ins and outs of modeling retinal neurons. You took a chance with me, and it (eventually) paid off. I learned so much from you about the biophysical properties of neurons that still sticks with me, even almost ten years later. Thanks to everyone in Peter Sterling's lab.

Thanks to my friends James Bonaiuto and Lex Kravitz, we've worked with each other and grown together. May we some day live forever in robot bodies, or whatever. There are many other friends that I have left out, purposely, to hurt their feelings. Just kidding! Please don't feel left out, if you're my friend then you're important to me, thank you for reading my thesis.

Thanks to everyone in the Gallant lab, mad scientists, provocative thinkers and team players. Whether through your programming skills, your machine learning, or computing cluster, I was always entertained and enlightened by you all.

Thank you to the Redwood Institute for Theoretical Neuroscience. It's a special and rare thing to have so many Computational Neuroscientists all in the same building. Thanks for all the equations. Thanks to Guy Isley, for the RNN code and discussions. Thanks to Joan Bruna for helpful discussions about RNNs. Thanks to Mike DeWeese for asking me what I wanted to do in life. Thank you especially to Fritz Sommer, who has advised me from the beginning of graduate school. Your suggestions have always opened my mind, leading me into a forest of knowledge!

Thank you to everyone in the Theunissen lab, for your knowledge, your data, your friendship and laughs, and the cakes! Thanks to Julie Elie, everything in this thesis is based on the hard work you've done to collect Zebra finch vocalizations and record from their brains. Thanks to Tyler Lee and Wendy de Heer, for being supportive science buddies. Thanks to Bill Wood! Thanks to my predecessors; Taffeta Elliot, Noopur Amin, and Channing Moore. Thanks to the former undergrads and future successes, Michelle Carney, Mike Zhong, Milan Amin, Alfonso Bonilla, and Liz Chen.

Thank you to the Biophysics program for accepting me and especially Kate Chase, who has been critical in guiding me through the intricate dance of graduate school.

Thank you Frederic Theunissen. You're literally the nicest PI on the planet, an expert in time frequency analysis, a caring father to your children, an excellent and attentive teacher, hyena tamer and bird whisperer. I couldn't have done any of this without you!

Thank you Layla. You have emotionally supported me throughout graduate school and dealt with all the ups and downs. I love you and am excited about our future together. You're the best of the best!
