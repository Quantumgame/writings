We undertook a detailed analysis of population spike rate and LFP power in the Zebra finch auditory system. Utilizing the full range of Zebra finch vocalizations and dual-hemisphere multielectrode recordings from auditory neurons, we show how intuitive acoustic features such as amplitude, spectral distribution statistics and pitch drive the spike rate of individual neurons and  LFP power. Using decoding approaches, we show that these acoustic features can be successfully decoded from the population spike rate vector and the power spectra of the multielectrode LFP, and that multielectrode LFP outperforms spike rate. We find that adding pairwise spike synchrony terms to the spike rate decoder boosts performance to be on par with the LFP power spectra, and that decoder performance grows quickly with the addition of more neurons but quickly saturates. Finally, we demonstrate through predictive modeling that LFP power on an electrode is a mix of local spike rate and spike synchrony.
